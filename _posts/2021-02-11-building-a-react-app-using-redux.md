## Building a `React Redux` app
There is a simple template of a `React Redux` app available on the `Redux` documentation website.

It can be installed using the following command:
`npx create-react-app my-app --template redux`

In order to start the development version of the application you are building, just run:
`npm start`

There is a counter app included with this default package.

You can create your own app referring to this default counter app. Or you can follow the awesome tutorial given in the `Redux` website [https://redux.js.org/](https://redux.js.org/)

Make sure you use `git add -A` and `git commit -m "your commit message here"` every now and then to save snapshots of your code wherever required.

After you have done developing your app, you can apply the following steps to publish your code into a code sandbox.

### Step 1: Create a new repository
