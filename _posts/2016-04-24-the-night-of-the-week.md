So this weekend kicked off with an unusual thing.

A person I know from work, called me and said we could go for a drink.

He arrived in his car and picked me up. When we were in the car, told me that we were going to see his friend who just got a minor heart attack and was now in the hospital.

We went to hospital, where I met the friend who could walk now, shook hands with him. He couldn't speak very well, but managed to say his name.

Then, I met the younger brother of this friend and the three of us, the person I know from work, the brother of his friend who was in the hospital and I, went out in the car to buy a bottle of rum.

We came back to the hospital had poured a glass of rum each in the car.

We soon found that the friend had to be admitted in the hospital at which point we decided to continue drinking after we've paid him a visit at the cardiac patient's ward.

There we were joined by two more friends, one of them a construction worker and the other, a trusted divorcee father of two girls. Both of them were almost members of the family of the friend.

After everyone said their words to the friend who was to be taken care of the hospital, we all, now the five of us, four of us in one car (person I know from work, the construction worker, the father of two girls and me) and the brother of the friend in another car, went to the house of the friend to continue drinking.

There I met another younger brother of the friend (even younger than the one I met earlier) and his girlfriend.

The wife of the friend was also present.

She had prepared some mutton curry.

With the bottle of rum, we had also bought some fish vindaloo.

All of us, were sitting wherever we could in a circle and how the social exchanges followed is quite hard to put in words.

The youngest brother and me talked about technology every now and then since we had common interests.

The person I know from work kept talking to me to make sure I understood what was happening.

He, the brother of the friend and the construction worker would discuss in length about things in the local language Kreole.

The women of the house exchanged among themselves about I didn't know what.

A cat came about every now and then.

After three or more rounds of rum, the girlfriend of the youngest brother brought the baby of the friend to this circle.

The wife of the friend joined the circle too towards the end.

Stories were being told. About how the construction worker feels about his hour long journey to work on a bicycle and an even more exhausting one when he comes back.

About the grandfather of the person I know from work who used to go meet his lover (the grandmother) on a bicycle ride which would cost him an entire day giving him a window of only about an hour to talk to his lover.

When the wife of the friend was there in the circle, I told everyone the story of how the crabs were tied and kept in a basket in the fish markets of Kerala. And how my grandmother made the best crab curry.

All this while the father of two girls had found a place to crash and rest.

Me and the person I know from work left the house with guilty feeling of having smoked cigarettes when there was a baby in the house.

He dropped me back at home and before leaving, I told him how grateful I was for the time I spent. He said to me that I didn't speak their language or understand their culture and yet I had a good time and that's what life is all about.
