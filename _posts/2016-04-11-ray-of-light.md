I haven't been cooking lately. I haven't been leaving the house in the weekends. I have sort of given up learning French. Probably for the fourth time.

But it is at these crossroads that I come across a new beginning. All my thoughts aligning. My view of others around me, of where my life is going in better light.

It's like refreshing my mind before beginning again.

I enjoy the freedom. The choice. The choice of free will.

I like to make conversations. I like to communicate. I like meeting people, discovering the beautiful worlds that are not too far away when decide to be receptive.

I connected to the lady in a store, a smart woman who knows more than me about movies, a little girl who went shopping with her mum.

At the food corner, I could finally look at the young black woman and say some words out of my mouth.

It feels wonderful to connect.
