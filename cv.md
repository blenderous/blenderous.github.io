## About me
I am a front-end developer who is creative and also delivers.

Working with front end technologies means, making
interfaces for mobiles, tablets and desktop computers. A lot of effort goes
into making the concept made by the designers into something that can be
seen and interacted with on the screen.

I have also learned to make applications using `ReactJS`.

My ideal working environment is where the doors for conversations are
always open and ideas are constantly exchanged.

I prefer to communicate through writing a lot, but I prioritize getting though
hurdles of miscommunication verbally whenever there is a lack of clarity.
