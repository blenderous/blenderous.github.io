## About me
Graduated from BITS, I am a web developer who is creative and also delivers.

I am particularly fond of front-end development.

Making interfaces for mobiles, tablets and desktop computers. A lot of effort goes
into making the concept made by the designers into something that can be
seen and interacted with on the screen.

Sometimes, there is a necessity to make a website or an application without the help of a designer. In that case, I prefer to apply a suitable theme and adjust the look and feel of the website or application myself.

I have also learned to make applications using `ReactJS`.

Constant learning gives an edge in technology is my belief, so I keep learning through multiple mediums and implementing at realtime hands-on.

I also write a [tech blog](http://blenderous.github.io/) about my learnings.
