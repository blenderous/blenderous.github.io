## About me
I am a front-end devleoper who is aiming at full-stack javascript development.

I mostly work with front end technologies, so at the end of the day I make interfaces for mobiles, tablets and desktop computers. A lot of effort goes into making the concept made by the designers into something that you can see and interact with on the screen.

My ideal working environment is where the doors for conversations are always open and ideas are constantly exchanged.

I am usually very reserved. I prefer to communicate in writing a lot, but I proiritize getting though hurdles of mis-communication whenever there is a lack of clarity.
