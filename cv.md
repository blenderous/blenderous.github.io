## About me
Graduated from BITS, I am a web developer who is focused on Front End development.

Making interfaces for mobiles, tablets and desktop computers is my thing. I make the transformation of the concept made by the designers into something that can be
seen and interacted with on the screen.

I have also learned to make applications using `ReactJS`.

Constant learning gives an edge in technology is my belief, so I keep learning through multiple mediums and implementing at realtime hands-on.

I also write a [tech blog](https://blenderous.github.io/) about my learnings.
