## Careful!

The following is about my technical know-how. It is full of technical terms and jargon. Proceed with caution.

## Skillset

### Javascript (level: medium to advanced)

- have written a lot of `jQuery` (when it was popular)
- used Bootstrap javascript components and other plugins for simple interactive stuff on web pages
- working with `angular js` (`1.2.29` since this version is compatible with IE8) to make DOM manipulations, making interactive elements and to make front end code modular

### CSS (level: advanced)

- writing a lot of simple `CSS` to create proper layouts for the page/application
- using `LESS` or `SASS` preprocessors to make `CSS` more re-usable (by using `mixins` and `variables`)
- making changes in layouts and structure for better viewing in tablets and mobiles
- learning to make `CSS` more maintanable and easy to organize using naming conventions and maintaining custom libraries for widely used `CSS` utilities

### HTML (level: professional)

- writing meaningful and semantic html
- using templates in concurrence with back-end frameworks (like `liquid` for ruby and `blade` for `laravel`)
- interested in making elementary `html` using mixins or angular templates (trying to implement the philosophy of `polymer` using existing `html`, `css` and `js` standards)
