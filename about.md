## Me, myself and I

I am a front end developer.

Started out as someone who wrote websites using plain HTML and CSS, carving out images from a photoshop mockup and making sure nothing slipped out of place on IE5.5

## My Professional Self

1. I enjoy working on creative front end stuff in general.
2. I like to experiment with various javascript frameworks and go out of the way to make any possible workflow customizations, right from task runners to editor plugins, down all the way to shell scripts that make life easier.
3. I also enjoy peer programming, getting through tough challenges by talking to other programmers or helping someone solve a problem by just listening and providing valuable leads.
4. I also like to have a clear view of the project that I work on and almost always provide my insight about where it's at.

## Dream

There is a lot of tehchnophobia everywhere.

People are afraid of code or to talk know about technologies.

I want to be part of building a programming environment that would be really easy to get familiarized to. It would be something that could be used by creatives, developers and executives alike, each in their own way.

Each one of these would get interact with their machines in their own terms and in their own universe of words.

It's a really far away dream, I know :)

## How I would describe myself

I would like to be the person who is both creative and also delivers.

I am also a bit of a scientist because I like to get to the bottom of things and figure out how something is the way it is.

Because I am mostly working with front end technologies, at the end of the day I create interfaces for mobiles, tablets and desktop computers. A lot of effort goes into making the concept made by the designers into something that you can see and interact with on the screen.

I am quite good at making responsive layouts and with the guidance of a designer, I could make an interface more interactive and user friendly.

I like improving my working environment and I usually have suggestions and ways to do things in a more organic manner. I totally love to be in a place where ideas are discussed and where there is room for conversation.

I am usually quite shy and reserved. I prefer to communicate in writing a lot, but I also enjoy a casual chat every now and then.

Although I might not have good presentation skills, I usually feel comfortable talking about something that I am good at.

I can also make a fairly good presentation when I have spent enough time learning about the subject and feel confident enough to share my knowledge.
