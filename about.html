    <p>Hi there! I don't like to talk much about myself, but here it goes.
    I am not a huge fan of technology. Yes, I prefer to read a book or draw a picture.
    So then why am I sitting here, coding away?
    It's a question I ask myself everyday.</p>

    <p>PS: This blog is a way I hope to find answers to the questions I face everyday.
    To keep track of where we are and see where It's heading to.
