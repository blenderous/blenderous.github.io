# My Blog

My name is harish.
Love to write code, especially javascript, SASS and meaningful HTML.
I like the Node environment, Atom text editor and GIT source control.
While not writing code, I am usually wondering about the future of humanity
and how the lives of everyone will be transformed in the next few years
by virtue of technology.

This is my github blog.
